# End of Life
This project is now End of Life.  The SAP Open Source Program Office (OSPO) has determined that no teams are currently supporting this project, and therefore, no additional fixes or changes will be made.

Users are welcome to fork this project for their own use, however, SAP will not be able to offer any support for the project after November 1, 2018.  

At this time, the project will only be archived.  The archive will be left online unless one of the following events takes place:

- The project has a known security flaw
- Features in the SAP Cloud, specifically the Web IDE, are no longer compatible with this code

If either event is reported to the team, or to the SAP GitHub admins, the project will be given 30 days and then removed from GitHub.

Please contact the original owners if you have any questions, or wish to report either a security or compatibility issue.
